Neev RTE Mitra â€” Offline PWA Package
===================================

What's inside:
- neev_rte_pwa_index.html  -> Single-file Progressive Web App (open in browser)
- neev_rte_template.csv    -> CSV template to collect survey data
- Neev_RTE_Volunteer_Instructions.pdf -> Volunteer guide (Hindi)
- This README provides hosting and usage instructions.

How to use (quick):
1. Put all files on your computer or phone.
2. Open 'neev_rte_pwa_index.html' in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge on Android recommended).
3. Use the 'Add / Edit Child Survey' form to add records offline.
4. Use 'Import CSV' to bulk-import data from the provided CSV template.
5. Use 'Export CSV' to download collected data and share with funders or devs.
6. To install as app: in Chrome on Android, open the page, then use browser menu > 'Add to Home screen'.

How to host on GitHub Pages (free):
1. Create a GitHub repository (public or private).
2. Upload the files (index.html should be at repository root).
3. In repository 'Settings' > 'Pages', set source to 'main branch' and root folder '/', then Save.
4. Your site will be available at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo-name>/neev_rte_pwa_index.html
   (Use that URL on mobile browsers; users can Add to Home Screen.)

Notes:
- This PWA stores data locally in the device's browser (IndexedDB). Data stays on the device.
- For team-sharing, continue to import/export CSVs between devices.
- If you need a web-hosted sync or central database later, we can integrate Firebase or another backend.

If you want, I can:
- Upload this ZIP for you to download right now.
- Guide you step-by-step to host on GitHub and make a shareable link.
